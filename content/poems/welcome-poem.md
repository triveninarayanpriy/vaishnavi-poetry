Welcome triveni to your poetry collection,
Where words dance freely on the page,
Each verse a heartfelt reflection,
Each line a turn upon life's stage.

This CMS is yours to command,
Create, edit, and share with ease,
Your poems now at your command,
Flowing like a gentle breeze.

Visit /admin to begin,
Write your heart, let creativity soar,
Your journey starts from within,
Open the dashboard, unlock the door.
